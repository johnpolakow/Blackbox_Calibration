    sudo systemctl edit --full Blackberry.service

    then stop and start the service to update the config











To get access to /dev/usbtmc0 here are the steps:

create new group usbtmc:

sudo groupadd usbtmc

Add pi to the group:

sudo gpasswd -a pi usbtmc


list owner and group of usbtmc0:

la /dev/usbtmc0


create a new rules file for the device:
list the device id and product string with lsusb:

lsusb

for us its 0b21 and 0025

go to /dev/udev/rules.d
create a new file with following convention:

[number]-device-.rules
number is the order the rules are executed in when plugging in the device

11-yokogawa-wt310e.rules
sudo vi 11-yokogawa-wt310e.rules


Enter the following into the file. Make sure the quantity of equals signs match exactly

SUBSYTEM=="usb", ACTION=="add", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0b21", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0025", GROUP="usbtmc", MODE="0666"

KERNEL=="usbtmc[0-9], GROUP="usbtmc", MODE="0666"
KERNEL=="usbtmc*, GROUP="usbtmc", MODE="0666"


to reload the rules do: 
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger

now either reboot or unplug the device, then plug back in

then can list the device permissions again with:
la /dev/usbtmc0

you can see owner changed to usbtmc




daemon-reload
