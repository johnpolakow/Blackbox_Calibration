    // Temp Diode Voltage Accuracy && Conversion Accuracy
    // Temp Diode Voltages Calibrated at
    // REF100 actual current measurement
    // DC Load measurement accuracy
    // Thermocouples accuracy

    // After calibration, 2 cooldowns, comparing Pi aquired data to instruments.
        // Record variances at any particular values, and conditions of variance
        // if necessary, improve the calibration.
        // Do a test run applying both heat and cold, note differences in measurement

    // Report: Variance in each range, test conditions, outlier data points, how often there were outliers
    // Expected Accuracy for each range
    // any limitations
    // graphs of pi measured values vs HP measured values, multiple runs. Temps to test: 15C (59 degF), 23C (73.4 degF), 35C (95 degF)


// Check variance vs last calibration  for each test run. Try to capture an "average" calibration value
    // Scenarios to check:
        // Long term holding pattern for high values of current - ? Does the measurement or programmed current drift ?
        // From dead cold start - ? does the measurement drift as it warms up ?
        // spraying the board with cold spray or heat - ? does it change the programmed or measured value ?
